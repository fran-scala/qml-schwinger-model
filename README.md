# Symetrizing Quantum Machine Learning for Quantum Field Theory

Classification of QFT Schwinger model states by means of a symmetry-aware QML algorithm

### Schwinger
This folder contains all the Python code for the Quantum Field theory analysis using geometric quantum machine learning techniques. The sub-folders are `asymmetric` and `symmetric`, which contain the results from the experiments.

In addition, you have three iPython files used to run the experiments:

- `Schwinger_circuit_asym.ipynb`
- `Schwinger_circuit.ipynb`
- `Generator.ipynb`

The Generator.ipynb file is used to generate the dataset.
